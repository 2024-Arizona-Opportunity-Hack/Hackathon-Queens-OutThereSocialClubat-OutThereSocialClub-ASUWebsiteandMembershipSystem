# Project Overview
Out There Social Club seeks to develop a mobile application integration of 
their WordPress API to facilitate access to the website without the need to open a browser.

With this integration, members of Out There Social Club would not need to utilize
their browser to log in and obtain their coupon deals; they could access them 
straight from the app.

# How we built it

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: Flutter
- Backend: WordPress
- Database: SQL
- APIs: MYSQL1
<!-- Add/modify as needed -->

# Problems We Faced
One unfortunate challenge we ran into was the inability to connect our frontend
to the backend using WordPress's API due to permissions not being in place for SSH
and SFTP connectivity.

# Accomplishments
As a team, we can confidently say that we dove head-first into a project that no 
one else in the entire hackathon wanted to take. As a team, we each got out of
our comfort zones and strived to get as much done as possible. As a result, we are
grateful of the technologies
proud of the work we were able to accomplish in these last 24 hours

# What we learned
We familiarized ourselves with WordPress and learned how to use the Flutter framework to emulate mobile devices in our systems. With this, we gained an understanding of the Dart programming language, which flutter uses in order to
develop mobile applications.

# What's next for Out There Social Club
Future deployments of Out There Social Club's mobile app includes full integration
to the SQL backend using WordPress's backend API, which include user auth, and coupon display.
